# Sonal's Simple Shell (LSH)

A basic command-line shell implemented in C to learn OS concepts like process creation, execution, and built-in commands.

## Features

- Executes external programs using `fork()` and `execvp()`.
- Supports built-in commands: `cd`, `help`, and `exit`.
- Reads and parses user input with dynamic memory allocation.
- Demonstrates basic Unix system calls like `chdir()`, `fork()`, `waitpid()`, and `execvp()`.
- Supports up/down arrows for command history.

make
```
